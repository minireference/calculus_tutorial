## Other calculus topics


In this section,
we focused on integration,
which is the main tool you need to ``import'' from calculus to understand probability theory.
There are many other interesting calculus topics like: limits, derivatives, sequences, and series.
Learning calculus will introduce you to a number of mind-expanding theoretical results,
like the \emph{fundamental theorem of calculus},
for example.
% (spoiler: integrals and derivatives are inverse operations).

We'll now give a bird's-eye view of these other topics in calculus,
and provide links to books and other resources you can use to learn more about calculus.

	% TODO: encourage independent study
	%	%so you'll know about them and be able to pursue on your own if you're interested.
