	\subsection{Act 2: Integrals as functions}

		The \emph{integral function} $F_0(b)$
		corresponds to the area calculation with a variable upper limit of integration $A_f(0,b)$:
		\[
			F_0(b) \; \eqdef \; A_f(0,b) = \int_{x=0}^{x=b} \! f(x)\:dx\,.
		\]
		%	Depending on the choice of the variable $b$,
		%	the integral function $F_0(b)$ describes the results of the integral calculation
		%	starting at $x=0$ and going until $x=b$.
		As a matter of convention,
		we denote the integral function using the capital letter of the same letter as the original function.
		% The \emph{integration variable} $x$ performs a sweep from $x=0$ until $x=b$

		Choosing $x=0$ for the starting point of the integral function is an arbitrary choice.
		We can obtain another integral function if we use $x=a$ as the starting point,
		$F_a(b)=\int_a^b \! f(x)\,dx$.
		The integral functions $F_a$ and $F_0$ differ only by a constant term:
		$F_0(b) = F_a(b) + C$, where $C = \int_{x=0}^{x=a} f(x)\,dx$.

		The integral function $F_0(b)$
		contains the ``precomputed'' information about the area under the graph of $f(x)$.
		Knowing $F_0$ allows us to compute the area using simple algebra calculations:
		the area under $f(x)$ between $x=a$ and $x=b$
		is equal to the \emph{change} in the integral function:
		\[
			A_f(a,b) = \int_a^b \! f(x)\,dx	=  F(b) - F(a).
		\]
		Intuitively,
		this formula computes the area $A_f(a,b)$ as the difference between the areas of two regions:
		the area until $x=b$ minus the area until $x=a$,
		as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:integral_as_difference_off}.

		\subsubsection{Example 1 revisited}
	
			We can easily find the integral function for the constant function $f(x)=~3$,
			because the region under the curve is rectangular.
			Choosing $x=0$ as the starting point,
			we obtain the integral function $F_0(b)$
			that corresponds to the area under $f(x)$ between $x=0$ and $x=b$
			as follows:
			\[ 
				F_0(b) = A_f(0,b) = \int_0^b \! f(x)\,dx	= 3 b.
			\]
			The region is a rectangle of height $3$ and with width $b$,
			as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:simple_integral_function_fx_eq_3}.

				\caption{	The integral function of the function $f(x) = 3$ is $F_0(b)=3b$.}
				\label{fig:simple_integral_function_fx_eq_3}
			\end{figure}
			
			Knowing the function $F_0(b)$ allows us to compute the area under the graph of $f(x)$
			between $x=0$ and $x=5$ as the difference
			$A_f(0,5) = F_0(5) - F_0(0) = 3\cdot 5 - 3\cdot 0 = 15$.
	
	
		\subsubsection{Example 2 revisited}
		
			Consider now the area under the graph of the line $g(x)=x$,
			starting from $x=0$.
			Since the region is triangular,
			we can compute its area using the formula for the area of a triangle:
			base times height divided by two.
			The integral function of $g(x)$ is:
			\[
				G_0(b) = A_g(0,b) = \int_0^b g(x) \, dx = \tfrac{1}{2} ( b \cdot b ) = \tfrac{1}{2}b^2.
			\]
			% The area of a triangle with base $b$ and height $b$ is equal to $\frac{1}{2}b^2$.

				\label{fig:simple_integral_function_gx_eq_x}
			\end{figure}
			
			Knowing the function $G_0(b)$ allows us to compute the area under the graph of $g(x)$
			between $x=0$ and $x=5$ as the difference
			$A_g(0,5) = G_0(5) - G_0(0) = \frac{1}{2}5^2 - \frac{1}{2}0^2 = 12.5$.
	
	
		%	But don't worry,
		%	you don't need to take an integral calculus to learn statistics.
		%	What is important right now is that you understand the concept of integration.
		%	The integral of a function is the area under the graph of the function,
		%	which is in some sense the total amount of the function accumulated during some interval of time.
	

		\subsubsection{Example 3 revisited}
		
			The the area under $h(x) = 4 - x^2$ from $x=0$ until $x=b$
			is described by the following integral calculation:
			\[
				H_{0}(b) = A_h(0,b) = \int_{0}^b h(x) \, dx = \; ???.
			\]
			We were able to compute the integral functions $\int f(x)dx$ and $\int g(x)dx$
			thanks to the simple geometries of the areas under the graphs,
			but $h(x)$ is a curved region so it requires some new integration methods.
			In the next few pages,
			we'll learn about symbolic integration techniques that we can use
			to find the integral function $H_{0}(b)$.

	\subsection{Intermission}
	
		% (M)
		The integral in Example~3 was carefully chosen to motivate the need to learn more advanced
		methods for integration. How can we compute the integral function $H_{0}(b)$?
		Is there some formula that describes the area $A_h(0,b)$
		of the region shown in Figure~\ref{fig:integral_function_hx_eq_x}.
		% (M2)
		We previously used numerical methods to compute the particular area $A_h(0,2)$
		when $b=2$,
		but now we're looking for a general math formula that computes the value
		$H_{0}(b) = A_h(0,b)$ for any $b$.		
		% (M3)
		In the next few pages we'll use \emph{symbolic} calculations to fill in the ???
		with an exact formula obtained by manipulating math equations.
		% (M4)
		The secret weapon that will allow us to compute integrals using symbolic math
		is called the \emph{fundamental theorem of calculus},
		which we'll discuss next.
		% First use SymPy, which is like doing pen and paper calculations using Python as you scribe.
		% (M5)
		The section is the ``Intermission'' in the calculus show.
		I want you,
		dear reader,
		to have a break before next pages where the level of ``mathyness'' will increase significantly % ALT. substantially.
		As in a real-world intermission,
		this is also your chance to skip the rest of the ``Integration show.''
		Perhaps you have better things to do right now than being subjected to
		Ivan's teaching of advanced concepts you ``might'' want to know through model means of computation
		like Python and old-school math techniques like pen and paper.
		I won't get offended if you skip ahead---no worries!
		As a teacher,
		i'm happy that you now know that integrals are ``area under the graph of'' geometrically % calculations 
		and can be approximated numerically using Riemann sums.
		This are the key takeaways so I feel I've done my job!
		I think you should stay though---you might enjoy the knowledge buzz moments
		that are coming your way in the next few pages.
