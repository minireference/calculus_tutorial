	\subsection{Act 2: Integrals as functions}

		The \emph{integral function} $F_0(b)$
		corresponds to the area calculation with a variable upper limit of integration $A_f(0,b)$:
		\[
			F_0(b) \; \eqdef \; A_f(0,b) = \int_{x=0}^{x=b} \! f(x)\:dx\,.
		\]
		%	Depending on the choice of the variable $b$,
		%	the integral function $F_0(b)$ describes the results of the integral calculation
		%	starting at $x=0$ and going until $x=b$.
		As a matter of convention,
		we denote the integral function using the capital letter of the same letter as the original function.
		% The \emph{integration variable} $x$ performs a sweep from $x=0$ until $x=b$

		Choosing $x=0$ for the starting point of the integral function is an arbitrary choice.
		We can obtain another integral function if we use $x=a$ as the starting point,
		$F_a(b)=\int_a^b \! f(x)\,dx$.
		The integral functions $F_a$ and $F_0$ differ only by a constant term:
		$F_0(b) = F_a(b) + C$, where $C = \int_{x=0}^{x=a} f(x)\,dx$.

		The integral function $F_0(b)$
		contains the ``precomputed'' information about the area under the graph of $f(x)$.
		Knowing $F_0$ allows us to compute the area using simple algebra calculations:
		the area under $f(x)$ between $x=a$ and $x=b$
		is equal to the \emph{change} in the integral function:
		\[
			A_f(a,b) = \int_a^b \! f(x)\,dx	=  F(b) - F(a).
		\]
		Intuitively,
		this formula computes the area $A_f(a,b)$ as the difference between the areas of two regions:
		the area until $x=b$ minus the area until $x=a$,
		as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:integral_as_difference_off}.

		\subsubsection{Example 1 revisited}
	
			We can easily find the integral function for the constant function $f(x)=~3$,
			because the region under the curve is rectangular.
			Choosing $x=0$ as the starting point,
			we obtain the integral function $F_0(b)$
			that corresponds to the area under $f(x)$ between $x=0$ and $x=b$
			as follows:
			\[ 
				F_0(b) = A_f(0,b) = \int_0^b \! f(x)\,dx	= 3 b.
			\]
			The region is a rectangle of height $3$ and with width $b$,
			as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:simple_integral_function_fx_eq_3}.

				\label{fig:simple_integral_function_fx_eq_3}
			\end{figure}
			
			Knowing the function $F_0(b)$ allows us to compute the area under the graph of $f(x)$
			between $x=0$ and $x=5$ as the difference
			$A_f(0,5) = F_0(5) - F_0(0) = 3\cdot 5 - 3\cdot 0 = 15$.
	
	
		\subsubsection{Example 2 revisited}
		
			Consider now the area under the graph of the line $g(x)=x$, starting from $x=0$.
			Since the region under the curve is triangular,
			we can compute its area using the formula for the area of a triangle:
			base times height divided by two.
		
			The general formula for the area under $g(x)$ from $x=0$ until $x=b$
			is described by the following integral calculation:
			\[
				G_0(b) = A_g(0,b) = \int_0^b g(x) \, dx = \tfrac{1}{2} ( b\times b ) = \tfrac{1}{2}b^2.
			\]
		
		The area of a triangle with base $b$ and height $b$ is equal to $\frac{1}{2}b^2$.

				\label{fig:simple_integral_function_gx_eq_x}
			\end{figure}
			
			Knowing the function $G_0(b)$ allows us to compute the area under the graph of $g(x)$
			between $x=0$ and $x=5$ as the difference
			$A_g(0,5) = G_0(5) - G_0(0) = \frac{1}{2}5^2 - \frac{1}{2}0^2 = 12.5$.
	
	
		%	But don't worry,
		%	you don't need to take an integral calculus to learn statistics.
		%	What is important right now is that you understand the concept of integration.
		%	The integral of a function is the area under the graph of the function,
		%	which is in some sense the total amount of the function accumulated during some interval of time.
	

		\subsubsection{Example 3 revisited}
		
			The the area under $h(x) = 4 - x^2$ from $x=0$ until $x=b$
			is described by the following integral calculation:
			\[
				H_{-2}(b) = A_h(-2,b) = \int_{-2}^b h(x) \, dx = \; ?.
			\]
			We were able to compute the integrals $\int f(x)\,dx$ and $\int g(x)\,dx$
			thanks to the simple geometries of the areas under the graphs,
			but $h(x)$ is a curved region so it requires some new integration methods.
			In the next few pages,
			we'll learn about symbolic integration techniques that we can use
			to find the integral function $H_{-2}(b)$.
			% $H_{-2}(b) = -\frac{1}{3}b^3 + 4b + \frac{16}{3}$.

%	There is an entire course called integral calculus which is dedicated to the task of finding integrals
%	using various tricks and techniques.




%	Taking a calculus course would be useful if you plan to study physics or engineering,
%	but for the purpose of learning probability and statistics,
%	you're not required to learn all these integration techniques.
%	Instead,
%	you can rely on computers to do integration for you.
%	Specifically,
%	you can use the Python modules SciPy and SymPy to compute all the integrals you need,
%	as we'll show in the next two sections.

% Robyn said: 	Confusing that before you said that integrals is a topic that can't be skipped,
%			and here you say that you can rely on computers.
% 			If they don't need to know the math, then perhaps this section could be made even shorter.
