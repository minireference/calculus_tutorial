\section{Math prerequisites}

	Before we dig into the new calculus topics,
	let's do a quick review of some key concepts from high school math.
	These are the basic building blocks I assume you've seen before,
	or at least heard about them.

	\subsection{Notation for sets and intervals}
	
		Sets are collections of math objects.
		Many math ideas are expressed in the language of sets,
		so it's worth knowing the notation conventions for sets.
	
		\begin{itemize}

			% \item $S,T$: the usual variable names for sets

			\item $\{ \textrm{  definition  } \}$: the curly brackets surround the definition of a set,
				and the expression inside the curly brackets describes what the set contains.
				% The math symbol ``$|$'' is shorthand for the phrase ``such that'' and it is often used in definitions.

			\item $s \in S$: this statement is read ``$s$ is an element of $S$'' or ``$s$ is in $S$''
	
			% seems not needed; put back if needed somewhere in the book (grep for it)
			%	\item $\emptyset$: the \emph{empty set} is a set that contains no elements.
			%		Mathematicians adopted the symbol $\emptyset$ because the notation $\{ \, \}$ is confusing.
	
	
			\item $\mathbb{N}$: the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}\eqdef \{0,1,2,3,4,5,\ldots\}$
	
			\item $\mathbb{N}_+$: the set of positive natural numbers $\mathbb{N}_+ \eqdef \{1,2,3,4,5,\ldots\}$.

			%	\item $\mathbb{Z}$: the set of integers $\mathbb{Z}\eqdef\{\ldots,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\ldots\}$
			%
			%	\item $\mathbb{Q}$: the set of rational numbers,
			%		$\mathbb{Q} \eqdef \left\{  \frac{m}{n} \; \Big| \; m \in \mathbb{Z}, \; n \in \mathbb{N}, \; n \neq 0  \right\}$.
			%		The set $\mathbb{Q}$ consists of all numbers that can be expressed as \emph{fractions} of the form $\frac{m}{n}$,
			%		where $m$ is an integer, $n$ is a natural number, and $n \neq 0$.
	
			\item	$\mathbb{R}$: the set of real numbers.
	
			\item	$\mathbb{R}_+$: the set of nonnegative real numbers.
	
		\end{itemize}
	
		\noindent
		We often use the \emph{set-builder} notation $\{\, \cdot \; | \;  \cdot \, \}$ to define sets.
		Inside the curly brackets,
		we first describe the general kind of mathematical objects we are talking about,
		followed by the symbol ``$|$'' (which stands for ``such that''),
		followed by the conditions that identifies the elements of the set.
		For example,
		the nonnegative real numbers $\mathbb{R}_+$
		are defined as ``all real numbers $x$ such that $x \geq 0$,''
		which can be expressed more compactly as 
		$\mathbb{R}_+ \eqdef \{ x \in \mathbb{R} \; | \; x \geq 0 \}$
		using the set-builder notation.


		\subsubsection{The number line}
	
			The \emph{number line} is a visual representation of the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$,
			as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:number_line_rationals_and_reals}.
			The real numbers correspond to all the points on the number line,
			from $-\infty$ to $\infty$.
		
			\begin{figure}[htb]
				\centering
				\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{figures/calculus/number_line_rationals_and_reals.pdf}
				\vspace{-2mm}
				\caption{The real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ cover the entire number line.}
				\label{fig:number_line_rationals_and_reals}
			\end{figure}
		
			\noindent
			The set of real numbers includes
			the natural numbers $\{0,1,2,3,\ldots\}$,
			the integers $\{\ldots, -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\ldots\}$,
			the rational numbers like $\frac{5}{3}$, $\frac{22}{7}$, $1.5$,
			as well as irrational numbers like $\sqrt{2}$, $e$, and $\pi$.
			This means any number you run into when solving a math problem
			can be visualized as a point on the number line.
	
			The number line extends forever to the left and to the right.
			We use the notation $-\infty$ (negative infinity)
			to describe larger and larger negative numbers,
			and $+\infty$ to describe larger and larger positive numbers.
			Remember what we said in the introduction,
			$\infty$ is not a number but a process.
			% ALT. not a destination you can get to 



		\subsubsection{Number intervals}
	
			The number line can be used to represent subsets of the real numbers,
			which we call \emph{intervals}.
			Figure~\ref{fig:interval_2closed_to_4closed}
			shows an illustration of the interval $[2,4] \eqdef \{ x \in \mathbb{R} \;|\; 2 \leq x \leq 4 \}$,
			which is the subset of the real numbers between $2$ and $4$.
		
			\begin{figure}[htb]

				\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{figures/calculus/interval_2closed_to_4closed.pdf}
				\vspace{-3mm}
				\caption{	The interval $[2,4] \protect\eqdef \{ x \in \mathbb{R} \; | \; 2 \leq x \leq 4 \}$
						is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$.} % the real numbers.
				\label{fig:interval_2closed_to_4closed}
			\end{figure}
	
	
	
	\subsection{Functions}
	
		A \emphindexdef{function} is a mathematical object that takes numbers as inputs and produces numbers as outputs.
		The output of the function $f$ for the input $x$ is denoted $f(x)$.
		For example,
		the function $f(x) \eqdef \frac{1}{2}x^2$
		takes any number $x$ as input,
		squares it and divides the result by two to produce the output.
		For example,
		$f(3) = \frac{1}{2} 3^2 = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5$.
		Here is the Python code that defines the function \tt{f}
		and evaluates it for the input $x=3$.

		\begin{codeblock}[def-fx-one-half-x-squared]
		>>> def f(x):
		        return 0.5 * x**2
		>>> f(3)
		4.5
		\end{codeblock}
		
		\noindent
		Not the Python syntax for evaluating the function \tt{f} on the input \tt{3}
		is the same as the math syntax $f(3)$.
	
		\subsubsection{Function graphs}

			The \emph{graph} of a function is a line that passes through all input-output pairs of a function.
			%	Imagine we take out a piece of paper and draw a coordinate system
			%	with a horizontal axis and a vertical axis.
			%	The horizontal axis describes the different input values $x$,
			%	while the vertical axis describes the output values $f(x)$.
			Each input-output pair of the function $f$ corresponds to the point $(x,f(x))$ in a coordinate system.
			We obtain the graph of the function by varying the input coordinate $x$ and plotting all the points $(x, f(x))$,
			as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:graph_of_f_nonnegative}.
			%
			The graph of the function $f$ allows us to see at a glance the behaviour of the function for all possible inputs,
			and forms an essential visualization tool.
			Calculus calculations can be understood geometrically as operations based on the graph of the function.

			We can use the Python modules \tt{numpy} and \tt{seaborn} to plot the graph of any function.
			For example,
			consider the function $f(x) \eqdef \frac{1}{2}x^2$ that we defined earlier.
			We start by importing the module \tt{numpy} under the alias \tt{np},
			and evaluating the function for all inputs $x$ in the interval $[-3,3]$.

			\begin{codeblock}[plot-fx-minus3-to-plus3]
			>>> import numpy as np
			>>> xs = np.linspace(-3, 3, 1000)
			>>> fxs = f(xs)
			\end{codeblock}

			We used the function \tt{np.linspace} to create an array (a list of numbers) \tt{xs},
			which contains 1000 input values that range from $x=-3$ until $x=3$.
			Next we applied the function $f$ to the array of inputs \tt{xs}
			and stored the outputs of the function in the array \tt{fxs}.
			% which contains all the output values of the function for the input values \tt{xs}.
			At this point,
			the arrays \tt{xs} and \tt{fxs} contain $1000$ input-output pairs of the form $(x, f(x))$,
			which is exactly what we need to plot the graph of the function.
	
			\begin{codeblock}[plot-fx-minus3-to-plus3]
			>>> import seaborn as sns
			>>> sns.lineplot(x=xs, y=fxs)
			See Figure ¡\ref{fig:graph_of_function_f_eq_halfx2}¡ for the output.
			\end{codeblock}
	
			\noindent
			We imported the \tt{seaborn} module under the alias \tt{sns}
			then called the function \tt{sns.lineplot} to produce the graph of $f(x)$
			shown in Figure~\ref{fig:graph_of_function_f_eq_halfx2}.

			\begin{figure}[htb]
				\centering
				\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{figures/calculus/graph_of_function_f_eq_halfx2.pdf}%
				\vspace{-3mm}
				\caption{	Graph of the function $f(x)=\frac{1}{2}x^2$ from $x=-3$ until $x=+3$.
						The graph of the function $f$
						consists of all the coordinate pairs $(x,f(x))$
						over some interval of $x$ values.	}
				\label{fig:graph_of_function_f_eq_halfx2}
			\end{figure}
	
	
	
		\subsubsection{Inverse functions}
	
			The inverse function $f^{-1}$ % $f^{-1} \colon B \to A$
			performs the \emph{inverse operation} of the function $f$. % $f \colon A \to B$.
			If you start from some $x$,
			apply $f$,
			then apply $f^{-1}$,
			you'll arrive---full circle---back to the original input $x$:
			\[
				f^{-1}\!\big( \; f(x) \; \big) = x.
			\]
			In Figure~\ref{fig:functions-inverse},
			the function $f$ is represented as a forward arrow,
			and the inverse function $f^{-1}$ is represented as a backward arrow
			that puts the value $f(x)$ back to the $x$ it came from.
	
			\begin{figure}[htb]
				\centering
				\includegraphics[width=0.4\columnwidth]{figures/calculus/functions-inverse.pdf}
				\caption{The inverse $f^{-1}$ undoes the operation of the function $f$.}
				\label{fig:functions-inverse}
			\end{figure}
	
			For example,
			when $x \geq 0$,
			the inverse of the function $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2$
			is the function $f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{2x}$.
			Earlier we computed $f(3) = 4.5$.
			If we apply the inverse function to $4.5$,
			we get $f^{-1}(4.5) = \sqrt{2 \cdot 4.5} = \sqrt{9} = 3$.

	
			\begin{codeblock}[fun-inv-fun-combo-log]
			>>> from math import exp, log
			>>> log(exp(5))
			5.0
			\end{codeblock}
	


		\subsubsection{Function properties}

			We often think about the possible inputs and outputs of functions.
			We use the notation $f \colon A \to B$
			to denote a function from the input set $A$ to the output set $B$.
			The set of allowed inputs is called the \emph{domain} of the function,
			while the set of possible outputs is called the \emph{image} or \emph{range} of the function.
			For example,
			the domain of the function $f(x)= \frac{1}{2}x^2$
			is $\mathbb{R}$ (any real number)
			and it's image is $\mathbb{R}_+$ (nonnegative real numbers),
			so we write it as $f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}_+$.
			
			%	Another important property is called \emph{continuity},
			%	which roughly corresponds to ability to draw a function without lifting the pen.
			%	We'll give a formal definition of continuity later in Section~\ref{limits:continuity}.


	\subsection{Function inventory}
	
		Your \emph{function vocabulary} determines which math expressions you'll be able to read
		in the same way your English vocabulary determines determines which English sentences you'll be able to read.
		We'll now list then essential functions that you should know about.

%explore these functions on your own via Wikipedia
%and by plotting their graphs on WolframAlpha.
%This section is a concise review of $10$ functions which are of paramount 
%important for all areas of mathematical modelling. 
%In order for you to be able to ``see'' the math behind science,
%you need to be familiar with these functions.
		
%	If you're seeing these functions for the first time, 
%	don't worry about remembering all the facts and properties on the first reading.
%	We'll use these functions throughout the rest of the book, so you'll 
%	have plenty of time to become familiar with them.
%	Remember to return to this section if you ever get stuck on a function.

%	% GRAPH PITCH
%	To build mathematical intuition, it's essential you understand functions' graphs.
%	Memorizing the definitions and properties of functions gets a lot easier with visual accompaniment.
%	Indeed, remembering what the function ``looks like'' is a great way to train yourself to recognize various types of functions.
%	Figure~\ref{fig:3x3_functions_miniplots} shows the graphs of some of the most important functions we'll use in this book.

				\vspace{-2mm}
				\caption{	Graph of six math functions you should know about.}
				\label{fig:panel_function_graphs1}
			\end{figure}





		\subsubsection{Constant function}
		
			The constant function $f(x) \eqdef c$ produces the same output $c$ for all inputs $x$.




		\subsubsection{Linear function}
		
			The linear function $f(x) \eqdef mx$ describes an input-output relationship
			where the output value $f(x)$ are \emph{proportional} to the input value $x$,
			and the constant of proportionality is $m$.
			Geometrically,
			$m$ is the slope in the graph of $f(x)$.
			Figure~\ref{fig:panel_function_graphs1}
			show the graph of $f(x) \eqdef x$ which is the linear function with $m=1$
			for which the outputs $f(x)$ is equal to the input $x$.
			%
			More generally,
			we can define the line $f(x) \eqdef mx+b$,
			where $m$ describes the slope of the line,
			and $b$ describes the value of the function when $x=0$.
			% The inverse to the line $f(x)=mx+b$ is $f^{-1}(x)=\frac{1}{m}(x-b)$, which is also a line.

		%quadratic
		%square root
		%polynomial
		%exp
		%log


		\subsubsection{Quadratic function}
			
			The quadratic function $f(x) \eqdef x^2$ calculates the square of the input $x$.
			The name ``quadratic'' comes from the Latin \emph{quadratus} for square.
			Geometrically,
			$x^2$ is the area of a square with side length $x$.
			See Figure~\ref{fig:panel_function_graphs1}~(b) for the graph.
			%
			The outputs the quadratic function are always nonnegative numbers
			since $x^2 \geq 0$, for all real numbers $x$.
			%	$f(x)=x^2$ is \emph{two-to-one}: 
			%	it sends both $x$ and $-x$ to the same output value $x^2=(-x)^2$.



		\subsubsection{Polynomial functions}
		
			We can combine the constant, linear, and quadratic functions
			to obtain the polynomial function $f(x) \eqdef a_2x^2 + a_1x +a_0$,
			where $a_2$, $a_1$, $a_0$ are arbitrary constants,
			which are called the \emph{coefficients} of the polynomial.
			This is called a second degree polynomial,
			since the highest power of $x$ it contains is $x^2$.
			%
			The general equation for a polynomial function of degree $n$ is
			\[
				P_n(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + a_3x^3 + \cdots + a_nx^n.
			\]
			% A polynomial of degree $n$ has  $n+1$ coefficients: $a_0,a_1,a_2,\ldots, a_n$.
			Polynomials are a very useful family of functions.
			%	We call $a_0$ the constant term.
			%	$a_1$: the \emph{linear} coefficient, or \emph{first-order} coefficient
			%	$a_2$: the \emph{quadratic} coefficient
			%	$a_3$: the \emph{cubic} coefficient
			%	$a_n$: the $n$\textsuperscript{th} order coefficient
			%	$n$: the \emph{degree} of the polynomial.
			%	The degree of $f(x)$ is the largest power of $x$ that appears in the polynomial.

			% The roots of $f(x)$ are the values of $x$ for which $f(x)=0$.







		\subsubsection{Exponential function}

			The exponential function base $e=2.7182818\ldots$ is defined
			as $f(x) \eqdef e^{x} = \exp(x)$.
			The graph in Figure~\ref{fig:panel_function_graphs1}~(c) shows
			the values of the exponential function on the interval $[-2,2]$.
			%
			The graph of the exponential function $f(x)=e^x$
			passes through the following points:
			$(-2,\frac{1}{e^2})$, 
			$(-1,\frac{1}{e})$, 
			$(0,1)$, 
			$(1,e)$, 
			and $(2,e^2)$.
			%	
			%	For larger inputs 
			%	$(3,e^3)$, 
			%	$(4,e^4)$, etc.
			
			% $f(a)f(b)=f(a+b)$ since $e^ae^b=e^{a+b}$

			% The derivative (the slope of the graph) of the exponential function 
			%    		is the exponential function: $f(x) = e^x  \; \; \Rightarrow \; \; f'(x)=e^x$
			%	The function $e^x$ is the only function which is equal to its own derivative: $f(x)=f'(x)$.







		\subsubsection{Absolute value function}
		
			The \emphindexdef{absolute value} function tells us the size of numbers
			without paying attention to whether the number is positive or negative.
			We compute the absolute value of the number $x$ by \emph{forgetting} the the sign of $x$.
			Geometrically,
			$|x|$ corresponds to its distance between $x$ and the origin of the number line.
			%
			We see the absolute values whenever we apply
			the combination of squaring followed by square-root on some number,
			$\sqrt{ x^2 }  = |x|$,
			since squaring destroys the sign.




		\subsubsection{Square root function}
		
			The square root function is denoted $f(x) \eqdef \sqrt{x}$.
			The square root $\sqrt{x}$ is the inverse function of the square function $x^2$,
			when $x \geq 0$.
			% when the two functions are defined as $f : \mathbb{R}_+ \to \mathbb{R}_+$.
			The symbol $\sqrt{c}$ refers to the \emph{positive} solution to the equation $x^2=c$.
			Note that $-\sqrt{c}$ is also a solution of $x^2=c$.
			%
			Another notation for the square root function is $f(x) \eqdef x^{\frac{1}{2}}$,
			where the fractional exponent $\frac{1}{2}$ makes sense
			since if we square $x^{\frac{1}{2}}$,
			we get back to $x$:
			$\left(x^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)^2 = x^{\frac{2}{2}} = x^{1} = x$.
			%
			In addition to \emph{square} root,
			there is also \emph{cube} root $f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x}  = x^{\frac{1}{3}}$,
			which is the inverse function for the cubic function $f(x)=x^3$.
			We have $\sqrt[3]{8}=2$ since $2\times2\times2=8$.







		\subsubsection{Logarithmic function}
		
			The natural logarithm function is denoted
			$f(x) \eqdef \ln(x) = \log_e(x)$.
			The function $\ln(x)$ is the inverse function of the exponential $e^x$.


			The graph of the function $\ln(x)$
			passes through the following coordinates:
			$(\frac{1}{e^2},-2)$, 
			$(\frac{1}{e},-1)$, 
			$(1,0)$, 
			$(e, 1)$, 
			$(e^2, 2)$, 
			$(e^3, 3)$, 
			$(e^4, 4)$, etc.

	\subsection{Functions with discrete inputs}

		Later in this tutorial,
		we'll study functions with discrete inputs,
		$a_k : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$,
		which are called sequences.
		We often express sequences by writing explicitly the first possible value
		$[a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots]$,
		which correspond to evaluating $a_k$ for $k=0$, $k=1$, $k=2$, $k=3$, etc.



	\subsection{Geometry}
	
		We'll now briefly review some geometry formulas.
		
		\subsubsection{Circle}
		
			The area enclosed by a circle of radius $r$ is given by $A = \pi r^2$,
			where $\pi = 3.14159\ldots$.
			A circle of radius $r=1$ has area $\pi$.
			The circumference of a circle of radius $r$ is $C = 2 \pi r$.
			A circle of radius $r=1$ has circumference $2\pi$.

		
		\subsubsection{Rectangle}

			The area of a rectangle of base $b$ and height $h$ is $A = bh$.


		\subsubsection{Triangle}

			The area of a triangle
			is equal to $\frac{1}{2}$ times the length of its base $b$ times its height $h$
			$A = \tfrac{1}{2} b h$.
			% Note that $h_a$ is the height of the triangle \emph{relative to} the side $a$.

		\noindent
		The three area formulas are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:geometry_areas_circle_rect_triangle}.

	\subsection{Trigonometric functions}
	
		Consider a circle with radius $r=1$
		as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:trigonometric_functions_as_point_or_as_triangle}.
		% The \emphindexdef{unit circle} is a circle of radius one centred at the origin.
		The unit circle consists of all points $(x,y)$ that satisfy the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 1$.
		% and a point $P$ on that circle
		A point $P$ on the unit circle has coordinates $(P_x,P_y)=(\cos\theta,\sin\theta)$,
		where $\theta$ is the angle $P$ makes with the $x$-axis.

		\end{figure}

		% RADIANS
		In math,
		we use \emph{radians} to measure angles.


		\subsubsection{Sine function}

			The graph of the sine function $f(\theta) \eqdef \sin(\theta)$
			\emph{oscillates} up and down and crosses the $x$-axis multiple times,
			as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:panel_function_graphs2}~(a).
	
			%	The graph of the function $\sin(\theta)$  passes through the following $(x,y)$ coordinates:
			%	$(0,0)$, $(\frac{\pi}{6},\frac{1}{2})$, $(\frac{\pi}{4},\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})$, $(\frac{\pi}{3},\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$, 
			%	$(\frac{\pi}{2},1)$, $(\frac{2\pi}{3},\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$, $(\frac{3\pi}{4},\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})$, $(\frac{5\pi}{6},\frac{1}{2})$, and $(\pi,0)$.
			%	For $\theta$ between $\pi$ and $2\pi$,
			%	the function's graph has the same shape it has for $\theta$ between $0$ and $\pi$, but with negative values.
			%	
			%		Let's start at $\theta=0$ and follow the graph of the function $\sin(x)$
			%		as it goes up and down.
			%		The graph starts from $(0,0)$ and smoothly increases until it reaches 
			%		the maximum value at \mbox{$\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}$}. 
			%		Afterward, the function comes back down to cross the $x$-axis at $x=\pi$.
			%		After $\pi$, the function drops below the $x$-axis and reaches
			%		its minimum value of $-1$ at $x=\frac{3\pi}{2}$.
			%		It then travels up again to cross the $x$-axis at $x=2\pi$.
			%		This $2\pi$-long cycle repeats after $x=2\pi$.
			%		This is why we call the function \emph{periodic}---the shape of the graph repeats.
			
			%	    \item 	Domain: $\mathbb{R}$.
			%	    		The function $f(x)=\sin(x)$ is defined for all input values.
			%	    \item	Image: $\{ y \in \mathbb{R} \; | \;  -1 \leq y \leq 1 \}$.
			%	    		The outputs of the sine function are always between $-1$ and $1$.
			%	    \item	Roots: $\{\,\ldots, -3\pi, -2\pi,-\pi,0,\pi,2\pi,3\pi, \ldots\,\}$.\\
			%	    		The function $\sin(x)$ has roots at all multiples of $\pi$.
			%	    \item   	The function is periodic, with period $2\pi$: $\sin(x) = \sin(x+2\pi)$.
			%	    \item   	The $\sin$ function is \emph{odd}: $\sin(x)=-\sin(-x)$
			%	    \item   	Relation to $\cos$: $\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1$
			%	    \item   	Relation to $\csc$: $\csc(x) = \frac{1}{\sin x}$ ($\csc$ is read \emph{cosecant})
			%	    \item   	The inverse function of $\sin(x)$ is denoted as $\sin^{-1}(x)$ or $\arcsin(x)$,
			%	    		not  to be confused with $(\sin(x))^{-1}=\frac{1}{\sin(x)} = \csc(x)$.
			%	    \item	The number $\sin(\theta)$ is the length-ratio of the
			%	    		vertical side and the hypotenuse in a right-angle triangle with angle $\theta$ at the base.


		\subsubsection{Cosine function}

			The cosine function is the same as the sine function \emph{shifted} by $\frac{\pi}{2}$ to the left:
			$\cos(\theta) = \sin(\theta+\frac{\pi}{2})$,
			as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:panel_function_graphs2}~(b).

			%	The graph of the function $y=\cos(x)$  passes through the following $(x,y)$ coordinates:

			%		The cos function starts at $\cos(0)=1$, then drops down to 
			%		cross the $x$-axis at $x=\frac{\pi}{2}$.
			%		Cos continues until it reaches its minimum value at $x=\pi$. 
			%		The function then moves upward, crossing the $x$-axis again at 
			%		$x=\frac{3\pi}{2}$, and reaching its maximum value again at $x=2\pi$.

		\subsubsection{Tangent function}

			The tangent function is defined as the ratio of the sine and cosine functions:
			$\tan(\theta) \eqdef \frac{ \sin(\theta) } { \cos(\theta) }$.
			The graph of the function $f(x) = \tan(\theta)$ is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:panel_function_graphs2}~(c).

			%    \item	Image: $\mathbb{R}$
			%    \item	The function $\tan$ is periodic with period $\pi$.
			%    \item	The $\tan$ function ``blows up'' at values of $x$ where $\cos x=0$.
			%    		These are called \emph{asymptotes} of the function
			%		and their locations are $x=\ldots, \frac{-3\pi}{2},\frac{-\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{3\pi}{2},\ldots$.
			%		% The values of $\tan$ approaches $\infty$ from the left, and $-\infty$ from the right.
			%    \item   	Value at $x=0$: $\tan(0)=\frac{0}{1}=0$, because $\sin(0)=0$.

			%		       = \frac{ \sin(\frac{\pi}{4}) }{ \cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) }
			%		       = \frac{ \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}  }{ \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}  }

			%    			    \item	The number $\tan(\theta)$ is the length-ratio of the
			%    		vertical and the horizontal sides in a right-angle triangle with angle $\theta$.
			%    \item	The inverse function of $\tan(x)$ is denoted $\tan^{-1}(x)$ or $\arctan(x)$.
			%    \item 	The inverse tangent function is used to compute the angle at the base 
			%    		in a right-angle triangle with horizontal side length~$\ell_h$ and vertical side length $\ell_v$: 
			%		$\theta=\tan^{-1}\!\left(\frac{\ell_v}{\ell_h}\right)$.

		% APPLICATIONS
		We can use the trigonometric functions $\sin(\theta)$, $\cos(\theta)$, and $\tan(\theta)$
		to calculate the \emph{components} of vectors.
		Sines and cosines are also describe waves and periodic motion in physics.
