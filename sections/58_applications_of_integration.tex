	\subsection{Applications of integration}

		Intuitively,
		we use integrals whenever we want to
		compute the ``total'' of some quantity that varies over time or space.

		\subsubsection{Kinematics}

    			Calculus was originally invented
			to describing the equations of motion $x(t)$, $v(t)$, and $a(t)$ as a function of time $t$.
			%  given the forces acting on them.
			We call these the \emph{kinematics} equations,
			from the Greek word \emph{kinema} for motion.
			The velocity function $v(t)$ is the derivative of the position function,
			and the acceleration $a(t)$ is the derivative of the velocity:
			\[
				a(t) \overset{\frac{d}{dt} }{\longleftarrow} v(t) \overset{\frac{d}{dt} }{\longleftarrow} x(t).
			\]
			The starting point of kinematics the Newton's second law,
			which tells us the acceleration of the object of mass $m$
			that has a net force $\vec{F}_{\textrm{net}}$ acting on it is:
			$\tfrac{1}{m}\vec{F}_{\textrm{net}}(t) = a(t)$.
			Given the knowledge of acceleration $a(t)$,
			we can predict the position of the object $x(t)$ at any time $t$
			by ``undoing'' the derivative operations using integration:
			\[
				% \underbrace{ 
				  \tfrac{1}{m} \vec{F}_{\textrm{net}}(t)
				% }_{\text{dynamics}}
				\; = \; 
				\underbrace{ 
				  a(t) \; \overset{v_i + \int\!dt }{\longrightarrow} \; 
				  v(t) \; \overset{x_i + \int\!dt }{\longrightarrow} \; 
				  x(t) 
				}_{\text{kinematics}}.
			\]
			
			\noindent
			We use our knowledge of $a(t)$ and the initial velocity $v_i$ to obtain $v(t)$.
			We then use integration a second time to obtain $x(t)$ from $v(t)$,
			taking into account the initial position $x_i$ as the integration constant.			

			The case of \emph{uniform accelerated motion} (UAM) is of particular interest,
			since it describes the the trajectory of falling objects under the effect of gravity.
			An object of mass $m$ that has a constant net $\vec{F}_{\textrm{net}}$
			acting on it will experience a constant acceleration $a(t) = a$.
			We can use integration to find the velocity of this object at a later time $t=\tau$,
			\[ 
				v(\tau)	= v_i + \int_0^\tau a(t)\,dt
						= v_i +  \int_0^\tau a \,dt
						= v_i + a\tau.
			\]
			% where $v_i$ is the initial velocity of the object at $t=0$.
			Now that we know the velocity as a function of time $v(t)$,
			we can use integration a second time to find the position
			\[
				x(\tau)	= x_i + \int_0^\tau v(t) \, dt
						= x_i +  \int_0^\tau (v_i+at) \, dt
						= x_i + v_i\tau + \tfrac{1}{2}a\tau^2.
			\]
			Two simple calculus steps allows us to obtain
			the famous kinematics equation $x(t) = x_i + v_it + \tfrac{1}{2}at^2$,
			which describes the motion of objects undergoing constant acceleration $a$. % $a(t) = a$.
			Students taking a physics class are normally presented with this equation
			and it seems to come out of nowhere,
			but if you know calculus you don't have memorize it,
			you can always derive from first principles $a(t) = a$,
			and initial conditions $x_i \eqdef x(0)$ and $v_i \eqdef v(0)$.

			%	Note that the above calculations required knowing the initial conditions $x_i$ and $v_i$.
			%	These initial values were required
			%	because the integral calculations we performed only told us the \emph{change} in the quantities relative to their initial values.


		\subsubsection{Solving differential equations}
		
			Many important laws in science and engineering are described by \emph{differential equations}
			that specify unknown function $f(t)$ in terms of their derivatives $f'(t)$, $f''(t)$, etc.
			For example,
			in the starting point of the kinematics equations with constant acceleration
			is the differential equation $x''(t) = a$,
			and we use use integration (twice) to find the unknown function
			$x(t) = x_i + v_it + \tfrac{1}{2}at^2$,
			which is a \emph{solution} to the differential equation $x''(t) = a$.
			We can verify this by taking the second derivative of $x(t)$
			to confirm it satisfies $x''(t) = a$.

			Here are some other examples of differential equations and their solutions;
			
			\begin{itemize}
			
				\item In biology,
					unconstrained bacterial growth is described by the equation $b'(t) = kb(t)$,
					where $b(t)$ is the number of bacteria at time $t$.
					Intuitively,
					the number of new bacteria $b'(t)$ is proportional to the number of existing bacteria.
					The solution to this equation is $b(t) = Ce^{\lambda t}$,
					where $C$ describes the number of bacteria at time $t=0$.

				\item Radioactive decay is described by the differential equation
					$r'(t) = -\lambda r(t)$,
					where $r(t)$ describes the number of atoms of some radioactive element.
					The solution % to radioactive decays
					is $r(t) = Ce^{-\lambda t}$.

				\item Simple harmonic motion is described by the second order
					differential equation $x''(t) + \omega^2 x(t) = 0$,
					which has solution $x(t) = C_1 \sin(\omega t) + C_2 \cos(\omega t)$.

			\end{itemize}
			
			\noindent
			Taking a course on differential equations
			you'll learn all kind of tricks and techniques for solving differential equations.
			Integration plays key roles in all the techniques,
			since it allows us to ``reverse engineer'' the derivative operation.			
			%	We use integrals to solve differential equations.
			%	If we have to solve for $f(x)$ in the differential equation $\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = g(x)$,
			%	we can take the integral on both sides of the equation to obtain the answer $f(x) = \int g(x)\,dx + C$.


		\subsubsection{Probability calculations}
		% ALT. Probability and expectation calculations

			Integration is an essential tool for computing probabilities of continuous random variables.
			A continuous random variable $X$ is described by its \emph{probability density function} $f_X$
			and the probability of the event $\{ a \leq X \leq b\}$ is defined as the following integral:
			\[
				\Pr( \{ a \leq X \leq b\} )
				\eqdef
				\int_a^b f_X(x) \, dx.
			\]
			The probability density $f_X$ varies for different values of $x$,
			so if we want to compute the total probability of $X$ falling between $x=a$ and $x=b$,
			we must compute the integral of $f_X$.
			%
			For example,
			the standard normal random variable $Z$
			is described by the probability $f_Z(z) = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{ -\frac{1}{2}z^2 }$.
			To calculate the probability of the event $\{ -1 \leq Z \leq 1\}$,
			we must evaluate the integral $\int_{-1}^1 f_Z(z) \, dz$,
			which is easy to do using SciPy helper function $\tt{quad(fZ,a=-1,b=1)}=0.68269$.

			\ifthenelse{\boolean{FORSTATSBOOK}}{
				We also use integration to compute \emph{expectations}
				for quantities that depend on continuous random variables.
				The expected value of the quantity $G=g(X)$
				under the randomness of a continuous random variable $X$
				is defined as the following integral calculation:
				\[
					\EE_X[g(X)]
					\eqdef
					\int_{x \in \calX} g(x)f_X(x)\:dx.
				\]
				The expected value is computed by ``weighing'' each value of $g(x)$
				by the corresponding probability density for the event $\{X=x\}$,
				summed over all possible values for the random variable $X$.
				The mean $\mu = \EE_X[X]$ and the variance $\sigma^2 = \EE_X[(X-\mu)^2]$
				are two central concepts in probability theory and statistics
				that are computed as expectation integrals.
				Every time we use the $\EE_X$ notation in Section~\ref{sec:continuous_prob_distr},
				there is some integral calculation going on behind the scenes,
				so its good if you know to know a thing or two about integrals.
