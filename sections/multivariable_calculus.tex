\section{Multivariable calculus}

	Multivariable calculus is the extension of the ideas of differential and integral calculus
	to functions like $f(x,y)$ that depend on multiple input variables.
	You can plot a function $f: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}  \to \mathbb{R}$ as a \emph{surface},
	where the height $z$ of the surface above the point $(x,y)$ is function output $z=f(x,y)$.

	If you know single-variable calculus (derivatives and integrals),
	then then you won't have much new math to learn in multivariable calculus:
	it's essentially the same concepts but with more variables.

	\subsection{Plotting multivariable functions}

		Suppose the height of a mountain is described by the function $f(x,y)$.
		The coordinates $(x,y)$ tell us the horizontal position point in the $xy$-plane
		and the value of the function $f(x,y)$ represents the height of the mountain at those coordinate.

		We identify the $z$ coordinate with the hight of the mountain $z=f(x,y)$
		and graph the function $f(x,y)$ is as a surface in 3D as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:multivariable_caclulus_3d_surface_plot}.

		\end{figure}


		\noindent			
		Three dimensional surface plots are very good for visualizing multivariable functions,
		but they can be difficult to draw by hand.

		Another approach for representing function of the form $f(x,y)$ is to use a two-dimensional plot that shows the ``view from above'' of the surface $f(x,y)$.
		We can use colour to represent the height of the function through different sharing:
		darker-shading to represent large values of $f(x,y)$ and lighter-shading to represent small values of $f(x,y)$.			% TODO: update plot to show shading
		We can also trace \emph{level curves} in the plot,
		which is the same approach used for topographic maps:
		each level curve show the points that are at a certain height.

					The level curves at each 10m intervals are also shown.}
			\label{fig:multivariable_caclulus_topographic_map}
		\end{figure}


		\noindent
		The curve labeled 30m line you see in Figure~\ref{fig:multivariable_caclulus_topographic_map} represents
		the solution to the equation $30= f(x,y)$,
		where $f(x,y)$ is the height of this hill for all coordinates $(x,y)$ on the map.


		
	\subsection{Partial derivatives}
		
		For a function of two variables $f(x,y)$,
		there is an ``$x$-derivative'' operator $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$
		and a ``$y$-derivative'' operator $\frac{\partial}{\partial y}$.
		The operation $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}f(x,y)$ describes taking the derivative of $f(x,y)$ with respect to the input variable $x$,
		while keeping the input  variable $y$ constant.
		Taking the derivative of a multivariable function with respect to one of its input variables is called a \emph{partial derivative}
		and denoted with the symbol $\partial$.

		The partial derivative of $f(x,y)$ with respect to $x$ is
		\[
			\frac{\partial}{\partial x}f(x,y)
			=
			\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}
			\eqdef
			\lim_{ \delta \rightarrow 0}	\frac{f(x+\delta, y)-f(x,y)}{\delta}.
		\]
		Similarly the partial derivative of with respect to $y$ is
		\[
			\frac{\partial}{\partial y}f(x,y)
			=
			\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}
			\eqdef
			\lim_{ \delta \rightarrow 0}	\frac{f(x, y+\delta)-f(x,y)}{\delta}.
		\]
		Note that both $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$  and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ are function of $x$ and $y$.
		Indeed, we can ask the questions ``what is the slope in the $x$-direction''
		and ``what is the slope in the $y$-direction'' at any point $(x,y)$ on the surface of the function.
		That's precisely the information returned by the functions $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,y)$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x,y)$.

		TODO: example

		
	\subsection{Gradient}

		The operator $\nabla$ is a combination of both the $x$ and $y$ derivatives:
		\[
			\nabla f(x,y)
			\eqdef
			\left(
				\frac{\partial f}{\partial x},
				\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}
			\right).
		\]
		Note that $\nabla$ acts on a function $f(x,y)$ to produce a vector output.
		This vector is called the \emph{gradient} vector and it tells you the combined $x$- and $y$-slopes of the surface.
		More specifically,
		the gradient vector tells you the direction of the function's maximum increase---the
		``uphill'' direction at the surface of graph of $f(x,y)$ at the point $(x,y)$.
		The gradient vector is always perpendicular to the \emph{level curve} at that point.


	\subsection{Partial integration}
	
		We can perform integration with respect to one of the input variables:
		\[
			f(y) = \int_{x \in \mathbb{R}} \!\! f(x,y) \, dx
			\quad\text{and}\quad
			f(x) = \int_{y \in \mathbb{R}} \!\! f(x,y) \, dy.
		\]
		The result of this partial integration is a function of the variable that we didn't integrate.



	\subsection{Double integrals}
	
		The multivariable generalization of the integral $\int_{x \in I} f(x) \, dx$
		that computes the ``total'' amount of $f(x)$ on some interval $I=[a,b]$
		is the multivariable integral of the form:
		\[
			\int \! \int_{(x,y) \in R} f(x,y) \, dxdy,
		\]
		where $R$ is called the \emph{region of integration} and corresponds to some subset of the cartesian plane $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$.
		The idea behind multivariable integrals is the same as for single variable integrals---to compute the total amount of some function for some range of input values.
		For single-variable integrals,
		we split the region into thing rectangular strips of width $dx$.
		For double integrals we split the two-dimensional region of integration into small squares of area $dxdy$,
		and compute the total volume of a many vertical columns whose base area is $dxdy$
		and whose height is given by the function $f(x,y)$.

		TODO: explain "sweep along x then sweep along y" idea + hint at change-of-variables techniques


		%	% EXAMPLE		
		%	In the second part of multivariable calculus you'll learn how to do double integrals,
		%	which are integrals over two variables:
		%	\[
		%	  \int_{y=0}^{y=1}\! \int_{x=0}^{x=1} \!\! yx\;dxdy
		%	  	= \int_{y=0}^{y=1} \!\! \left[  y\frac{x^2}{2}\right]_{x=0}^{x=1} dy
		%	  	= \int_{y=0}^{y=1} \! \frac{y}{2}\, dy
		%		= \left[  \frac{1}{4}y^2\right]_{0}^{1}
		%		= \frac{1}{4}.
		%	\]
		%	Once you get over the initial shock of seeing two integral signs,
		%	you should be able to understand the above integral calculation.
		%	Proceeding from inside-out,
		%	a double integral is nothing more than two integral operators applied in succession.
		%	Instead of an interval of integration split into tiny integration steps $dx$,
		%	we have a \emph{region of integration} split into tiny integration boxes with area $dxdy$.
		%	In the above example, the region of integration is a unit square in the $xy$-plane.



	\subsection{Applications of multivariable calculus}

		\paragraph{Optimization}
		
			The notion of an uphill or downhill direction for the surface $f(x,y)$ turns out to be very useful for optimization.
			%	If you want to find the local maximum of a function,
			%	you can start at some point and keep moving uphill (in the direction of $\nabla f(x,y)$ and you'll arrive at a local peak of the mountain.
			%	Similarly,
			To find the lowest point on the surface (minimum value of $f(x,y)$),
			you can start at some point and keep moving downhill,
			that is in the opposite direction to the gradient $-\nabla f(x,y)$.
			% Figure~\ref{fig:multivariable_caclulus_topographic_map_waterflow_to_bottom} illustrates this process.
			% Consider the path of a water stream whose source in some arbitrary point on the surface of the mountain.
			Intuitively,
			this is the path that a water stream would take as it descends down the slope of the mountain until it reaches the minimum at the bottom of a valley.
			This intuitive notion of ``keep moving downhill until you get to a local minimum'' is
			the general idea behind the \emph{gradient descent} optimization algorithm which is very important for machine learning applications.

		%	\end{figure}

		%	We know we've reached the bottom of the valley,
		%	since the the gradient vector will be zero at the minimum of the function $f(x,y)$,
		%	since surface is locally flat there.
