\section{Integrals}
\label{sec:integrals}

	Integration is the process of computing the ``total'' of some function $f(x)$ accumulated over a range of inputs.
	The symbol $\int$, which we use to denote integrals,
	is an elongated letter~$S$, for the Latin \emph{summa}.
	This should give you a hint that integration is some kind of summation.
