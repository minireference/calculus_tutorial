\section{Integrals}
\label{sec:integrals}

	Integration is the process of computing the ``total'' of some function $f(x)$ accumulated over a range of its input values.
	The symbol $\int$ we use to denote integrals is an elongated letter~$S$,
	which is short for \emph{summa}.
	This should give you a hint that integrals are some kind of summation.
