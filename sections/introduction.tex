	\paragraph{Banking example}

		Consider the function $\textrm{ba}(t)$ that represents your bank account balance at time $t$.
		Also consider the function $\textrm{tr}(t)$,
		which corresponds to the transactions (deposits and withdrawals) on your account.

		Suppose you have a record of all the transactions on your account $\textrm{tr}(t)$,
		and you want to compute the final account balance at the end of the month $\textrm{ba}(30)$.
		You can use the integration procedure on the transactions $\textrm{tr}(t)$
		to calculate the total change in the account balance at the end of the month,
		relative to the account balance at the beginning of the month $\textrm{ba}(0)$.
		The end-of-the-month-balance calculation is described by the following equation:
		\[ 
			\textrm{ba}(30)		=	\textrm{ba}(0)	+	\int_0^{30} \textrm{tr}(t)\;dt.
		\]
		The integral $\int_0^{30} \textrm{tr}(t)dt$ describes the process of computing 
		the total of all the transactions that occurred between day $0$ and day $30$.
		The weird-looking integral sign ``$\int$'' comes from the Latin word \emph{summa} for sum.

		We use integrals every time we need to calculate the total of some quantity over a time period.
		The integral $\int_a^b q(t)dt$ is the calculation of the \emph{total}
		of some quantity $q(t)$ that accumulates during the time period from $t=a$ to $t=b$.

% Robyn said: 	Since this is in the intro, it makes it sound like integrals are only used to calculate a value over time. 
% 			We should make it clear that they can also be used to calculate probabilities
%			and other quantities over a range of values or outcomes.

		% TODO: mention accumulation can be done over any variable; from now on variables x, n, u, etc.
